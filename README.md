# Conquest Server

There's a public Conquest server at `conquestgame.online`.

To run a [Conquest](https://github.com/argosopentech/Conquest) server you need to export and [run this this repository as a Godot server](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_dedicated_servers.html).
